# Welcome to AgroUnity

AgroUnity is a photorealistic simulator developed for the generation of precision agriculture imagery for training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to be implemented in autonomous robots in farms.

## Publications

The performance of AgriUnity has been tested on multiple scientific experiments during the PhD development of Carlos Carbone in La Sapienza University of Rome. The results have been published in the following papers

* [Simulation of near Infrared Sensor in Unity for Plant-weed Segmentation Classification](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Simulation-of-near-Infrared-Sensor-in-Unity-for-Carbone-Potena/1999b23a7080c7248477f6da1a8b8b260eb7b918)

* [Augmentation of Sunflower-Weed Segmentation Classification with Unity Generated Imagery Including Near Infrared Sensor Data](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-84811-8_3)

In our simulator we have been able to photorealisticly simulate **sugar beets**, **potatoes** and **sunflowers**. Preview images are shown on the following images:

With procedural TODO

In the simulator you can create your own fields. We are currently working on developing a more user friendly setup for custom fields

## Other simulators

We developed AgriUnity to work in tandem with a swarm simulator that combines Gazebo with Unity. We call this simulator with high fidelity visuals and dynamics AgroSwarm
