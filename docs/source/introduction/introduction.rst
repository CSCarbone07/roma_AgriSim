Introduction
============

AgroUnity is developed for the generation of plant imagery for training of convolutional neural
networks (CNN). Additionally the levels can be built to generate excecutable files to work with our
swarm simulator `AgroSwarm <https://github.com/CSCarbone07/roma_quad_ai>`.

Starting
--------

After following the `installation guide <https://github.com/CSCarbone07/roma_agroUnity/wiki/Installation>`, open Unity Hub and open the project. The available levels
are in the scenes folder, to start the simulation in each of them press the play button on the
center top.
