# AgroUnity

## Welcome to the AgroUnity repo.

AgroUnity is a Unity project that can generate photorealistic imagery tested for convolutional neural network (CNN). 
The results have been tested against real imagery and have been published in:

* [Simulation of near Infrared Sensor in Unity for Plant-weed Segmentation Classification](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Simulation-of-near-Infrared-Sensor-in-Unity-for-Carbone-Potena/1999b23a7080c7248477f6da1a8b8b260eb7b918)
* [Augmentation of Sunflower-Weed Segmentation Classification with Unity Generated Imagery Including Near Infrared Sensor Data](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-84811-8_3)
